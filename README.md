# billboard-hot-100
Usage of web scraping on Billboard Hot 100 and the Spotify API to create a Spotify playlist.

This project shows how to use web scraping and the Spotify API to create a playlist of the current Billboard Hot 100 chart. You can modify the code to scrape other charts or websites and create playlists based on your preferences.

Before we start, you need to have the following:
- A Spotify account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/signup).
