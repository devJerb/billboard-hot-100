# billboard-hot-100
Usage of web scraping on Billboard Hot 100 and the Spotify API to create a Spotify playlist.

## Getting Started

Before we start, you need to have the following:
- Python 3.6 or later installed on your machine.
- A Spotify account. If you don't have one, you can sign up here.
- A Spotify Developer account. You can create one here.

Once you have the requirements, you can clone the repository and install the necessary packages by running the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bs4-spotipy-api.git`
`cd bs4-spotipy-api`

This project shows how to use web scraping and the Spotify API to create a playlist of the current Billboard Hot 100 chart. You can modify the code to scrape other charts or websites and create playlists based on your preferences.
